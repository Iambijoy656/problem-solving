// Sum Zero

// write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. the function should  find the first pair where the sum 0.
// return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist

// Example
//sumZero([-3,-2,1,0,1,2,3]) output: [-3,3]
//sumZero([-2,0,2,3]) output: [-2,2]
//sumZero([1,2,3]) output: undefined

function sumZero(arr) {


}

console.log(sumZero([-3, -2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3]));
